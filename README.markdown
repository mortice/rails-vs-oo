# Rails vs Object-oriented design #

Some slides for my Ru3y Manor talk.

## Viewing ##

This is a showoff presentation. So you need to:

    $ git clone git://github.com/mortice/rails-vs-oo.git
    $ cd rails-vs-oo
    $ bundle
    $ showoff serve

Alternatively, visit (rails-vs-oo.heroku.com)[rails-vs-oo.heroku.com] and
save yourself the hassle.
